THYROID NEOPLASMS

• Most thyroid neoplasms manifest as solitary thyroid nodules; only 1% of all thyroid nodules are neoplastic.

• Multiple genetic pathways are involved in thyroid carcinogenesis. Conventional papillary carcinomas harbor either fusions (RET/ PTC, NTRK) or BRAF point mutations. Follicular neoplasms of all subtypes are characterized by oncogenic RAS mutations and PAX8/PPARG fusions. Progression to aggressive neoplasms is associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and TERT mutations.

• Follicular adenomas and carcinomas both are composed of well-differentiated follicular epithelial cells; the latter are dis- tinguished by evidence of capsular and/or vascular invasion.

• Conventional papillary carcinomas are recognized based on nuclear features (ground-glass nuclei, pseudoinclusions), even in the absence of papillae. Psammoma bodies are a characteristic feature of papillary cancers; these neoplasms often metastasize by way of lymphatics, but the prognosis is excellent.

• Encapsulated variants of papillary carcinoma without capsular or lymphatic invasion have recently been named noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features to emphasize their ultra–low-risk potential for metastasis or recurrence.

• Poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas are thought to arise from more differentiated thyroid carcinomas. They are highly aggressive, often lethal cancers.

• Medullary cancers are neoplasms arising from parafollicular C cells and can occur in either sporadic (70%) or familial (30%) settings. Multicentricity and C cell hyperplasia are features of familial cases. Amyloid deposits are a characteristic histologic finding.
