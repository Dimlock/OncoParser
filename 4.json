    "original_text": "Driver Mutations. Distinct sets of driver mutations in cancer genes are found in the four major histologic variants of thyroid cancer. Among follicular neoplasms, there are both unique and shared genetic alterations between the histologic subtypes (Fig. 24.18), most of which involve components of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway, which you will recall is frequently mutated in many different cancers (Chapter 7). As is also true with other epithelial neoplasms, precursor lesions (listed earlier) share genetic alterations with the corresponding variant of carcinoma, albeit at a lower frequency.\n• Conventional papillary thyroid carcinomas. Conventional PTCs have two defining genetic abnormalities: translocations that result in gene fusions of RET or NTRK, and point mutations in BRAF (see Fig. 24.18).\n• The RET gene is located on chromosome 10q11, and encodes an RTK that is normally not expressed in thyroid follicular cells. As with many other RTKs implicated in cancer, PTC rearrangements involving RET create fusion genes that encode constitutively active forms of RET tyrosine kinase. There are more than 15 fusion partners of RET, and two—designated PTC1 and PTC2—are most commonly observed in sporadic papillary cancers. Similarly, paracentric inversions or translocations of NTRK1, another gene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase on chromosome 1q21, are present in ~5% of PTCs. These rearrangements also produce constitutively active NTRK1 fusion proteins.\n• Between 50% and 80% of conventional PTCs harbor gain-of-function mutations in the BRAF gene, most commonly a valine-to-glutamate change in codon 600 (BRAFV600E). BRAF encodes a serine/threonine kinase that lies downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases in growth factor signaling pathways. In a subtype of conventional PTCs, known as “tall cell variant” (see later), BRAFV600E mutations are virtually a diagnostic sine qua non. The presence of BRAF mutations in conventional PTCs is associated with reduced expression of thyroid differentiation markers (such as thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase) and may be associated with a higher risk of extrathyroidal extension and recurrence. As discussed elsewhere, the BRAFV600E mutation is found in many other cancers including melanoma and hairy cell leukemia (Chapter 7).\n• Follicular neoplasms. In contrast to papillary carcinomas, follicular neoplasms are often associated with gain-offunction mutations in RAS. Neoplasms with RAS mutations retain expression of thyroid differentiation factors (e.g., thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase), which may contribute to their follicular growth pattern. Overall, approximately 20% to 40% of follicular adenomas and 30% to 50% of follicular carcinomas harbor RAS mutations (see Fig. 24.18). Similarly, approximately one-half of invasive encapsulated follicular variants of PTC and their putative precursor, noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features, demonstrate RAS point mutations.\n\nA unique (2;3)(q13;p25) translocation has been described in 20% to 50% of follicular carcinomas and ~10% of follicular adenomas. This translocation creates a fusion gene composed of portions of PAX8, a paired homeobox gene that is important in thyroid development, and the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gene (PPARG), which encodes a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in terminal differentiation of thyrocytes. Some noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillarylike nuclear features and invasive encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (up to one-third in some series) also harbor PAX8-PPARG fusion genes, which are almost never seen in poorly differentiated or anaplastic carcinomas. Finally, up to 10% of follicular carcinomas exhibit gain-of-function mutations of PIK3CA (the gene that encodes phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K]) or loss-of-function mutations of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene and negative regulator of this pathway (see Fig. 24.18).\n• Poorly differentiated and anaplastic (undifferentiated) carcinomas. These highly aggressive and lethal tumors can arise de novo, or, much more commonly, by “de-differentiation” of a papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. In addition to driver mutations that are also seen in well-differentiated thyoid cancers, three recurrent genetic “hits”—point mutations of TP53, beta-catenin (CTNNB1), and TERT (which encodes the catalytic component of the enzyme telomerase)—are essentially restricted to poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas and likely have central roles in their genesis and aggressive behavior.\n• Medullary thyroid carcinomas. Familial medullary thyroid carcinomas occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2 (MEN-2, see later) and are associated with germline RET mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the receptor. RET mutations are also seen in approximately one-half of nonfamilial (sporadic) medullary thyroid cancers. Chromosomal rearrangements involving RET, such as the RET/PTC translocations reported in papillary cancers, are not seen in medullary carcinomas.\n\nEnvironmental Factors. The major risk factor predisposing to thyroid cancer is exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly during the first two decades of life. In keeping with this, there was a marked increase in the incidence of conventional PTCs among children exposed to ionizing radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. Of  interest, radiation-induced PTCs have a higher frequency of chromosome rearrangements that produce gene fusions, possibly because of the ability of ionizing radiation to induce double-stranded DNA breaks. Deficiency of dietary iodine (and by extension, goiter) is associated with a higher frequency of follicular lesions.",

            "text": "A unique (2;3)(q13;p25) translocation has been described in 20% to 50% of follicular carcinomas and ~10% of follicular adenomas. This translocation creates a fusion gene composed of portions of PAX8, a paired homeobox gene that is important in thyroid development, and the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gene (PPARG), which encodes a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in terminal differentiation of thyrocytes. Some noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillarylike nuclear features and invasive encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (up to one-third in some series) also harbor PAX8-PPARG fusion genes, which are almost never seen in poorly differentiated or anaplastic carcinomas. Finally, up to 10% of follicular carcinomas exhibit gain-of-function mutations of PIK3CA (the gene that encodes phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K]) or loss-of-function mutations of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene and negative regulator of this pathway (see Fig. 24.18).\n• Poorly differentiated and anaplastic (undifferentiated) carcinomas. These highly aggressive and lethal tumors can arise de novo, or, much more commonly, by “de-differentiation” of a papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. In addition to driver mutations that are also seen in well-differentiated thyoid cancers, three recurrent genetic “hits”—point mutations of TP53, beta-catenin (CTNNB1), and TERT (which encodes the catalytic component of the enzyme telomerase)—are essentially restricted to poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas and likely have central roles in their genesis and aggressive behavior.\n• Medullary thyroid carcinomas. Familial medullary thyroid carcinomas occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2 (MEN-2, see later) and are associated with germline RET mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the receptor. RET mutations are also seen in approximately one-half of nonfamilial (sporadic) medullary thyroid cancers. Chromosomal rearrangements involving RET, such as the RET/PTC translocations reported in papillary cancers, are not seen in medullary carcinomas.",

In keeping with this, there was a marked increase in the incidence of conventional PTCs among children exposed to ionizing radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. Of  interest, radiation-induced PTCs have a higher frequency of chromosome rearrangements that produce gene fusions, possibly because of the ability of ionizing radiation to induce double-stranded DNA breaks. Deficiency of dietary iodine (and by extension, goiter) is associated with a higher frequency of follicular lesions.",
